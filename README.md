# mvsSchoolProjects

Here are 3 of my Microsoft Visual Studio school projects.

Calculator - basic calculator that functions like the windows one.

MusicChart - a program that allows making a music chart (artist, album, length) for multiple users, that used the SQLite Manager 
             extension on Firefox browser.

Notepad - a notepad where you can create files, save them, open existing ones, edit them (font, font-size, format, etc.), 
          print them (print preview) and search the document.
